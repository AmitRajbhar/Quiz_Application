# Quiz_Application
This is a Desktop quiz application that I built using Java Swing. It is a single-player game where the user can answer a series of multiple-choice questions. 
The questions are on a variety of topics, and the user's score is based on the number of correct answers.
The application is easy to use. The user simply clicks on the start button to begin the quiz. 
The questions are displayed one at a time, and the user has 10 seconds to answer each question. 
The user can choose from four answer options, and the correct answer is revealed after the time limit has expired.
The application keeps track of the user's score and displays the final score at the end of the quiz. 
The user can also view a list of all the questions and answers.
I built this application as a way to learn Java Swing. I am happy with the results, and I believe that the application is a fun and educational tool. 
I hope that others will find it useful.
